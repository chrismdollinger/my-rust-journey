# my-rust-journey
Documenting my journey learning the basics of Rust

## Tutorials to Follow
- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
  - In parallel, [The Rustlings Course](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)

## Rules of the Road
1. Coding exercises will get their own subdirectory inside `practice/`
2. Rustling exercises will live in `rustlings/`
3. In-Progress exercises will get their own issue, branch, and pull request to keep everything nice and tidy
4. I will probably break these rules immediately, please forgive me
